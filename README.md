# cloud-setup
This repo provides a quick repeatable setup for multi-cloud environments.
I use this setup because it is Cloud-agnostic( it can be instantiated in any cloud environment)

When you clone this repository, create a virtual environment, and make any change to the readme file. Push to github and the workflow will install current project dependencies, run tests and inform you of any failures.

This scaffolding includes the following files. You can make changes to suit your needs.

Makefile
hello.py
requirements.txt
test.py

Read me Documentation is still in progress.
